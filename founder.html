<h2>Operational Security Background</h2>

<p class="sub">
Hardline Privacy is founded by <strong>Grey</strong>, a U.S. military veteran and active law-enforcement professional specializing in operational security, open-source intelligence (OSINT), and exposure risk management.
</p>

<p class="sub">
Across military and criminal interdiction assignments, Grey worked in environments where information exposure directly impacted safety, investigations, and human lives. Intelligence analysis, digital tracing, and structured investigative workflows were used to locate violent and high-risk offenders while protecting officers, witnesses, and families from retaliation.
</p>

<p class="sub">
The same investigative principles are now applied defensively. Hardline Privacy uses disciplined exposure discovery, verified opt-out execution, and continuous monitoring to reduce publicly searchable personal data.
</p>

<p class="sub">
Hardline Privacy was created after firsthand experience with doxxing, harassment, and threats impacting family life and professional duties. The mission became clear: give ordinary families access to the same privacy protection methods used inside professional security and investigative environments.
</p>

<p class="sub">
For operational safety, identifying details remain intentionally limited. Grey continues serving in an active public-safety role and maintains privacy protections consistent with military and law-enforcement security standards.
</p>

<p class="small">
Academic background includes Criminal Justice studies in Indiana and legal education pursued in Tennessee through an accredited U.S. law program.

<h2>Why Hardline Privacy Exists</h2>

<p class="sub" style="max-width:760px">
Public data brokers and people-search sites replicate personal information across hundreds of databases. Most individuals never realize how exposed their household becomes until unwanted contact, fraud attempts, or harassment begins.
</p>

<p class="sub" style="max-width:760px">
Hardline Privacy exists to reduce that exposure using structured, human-verified processes instead of automated report generation.
</p>

<div class="container">
<h2>Defensive Use of Investigative Methods</h2>

<p class="sub" style="max-width:760px">
All research methods are used defensively and ethically. Techniques traditionally used to discover information are redirected toward removing visibility, validating removals, and preventing re-listing across broker networks.
</p>

<ul class="features">
<li>Human-verified removals</li>
<li>No automated scraping systems</li>
<li>No advertising profiles</li>
<li>No resale of personal data</li>
<li>Continuous monitoring after removal</li>
</ul>

<h2>A Note From the Founder</h2>

<p class="sub" style="max-width:760px">
Privacy protection requires discipline, persistence, and accountability. Every client engagement follows documented procedures designed to reduce exposure and maintain long-term protection.
</p>

<p class="sub" style="max-width:760px">
Hardline Privacy is built on one principle:
<strong>protect families the same way professionals protect themselves.</strong>

<h2>Take Back Control of Your Personal Information</h2>
<p class="sub">
Your exposure does not fix itself. Protection starts with visibility.
