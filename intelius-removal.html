    <h2>What Intelius listings typically include</h2>
    <p>Intelius profiles can display names, prior addresses, possible phone numbers, and relatives. The combination of these data points makes it easier for strangers to locate or contact a household. Removal focuses on taking the listing out of public search results and then monitoring for reappearance.</p>
    <p>Listings often come from multiple sources, which is why a single opt-out is rarely the end of the process. A broader removal plan addresses the same information across other broker sites.</p>

    <h2>Removal expectations</h2>
    <p>Opting out removes the listing from public search results on the site but does not erase the underlying records. Those records may still exist in other databases, which can lead to re-publication. Ongoing monitoring is the best defense against that cycle.</p>
    <p>Successful removal depends on accurate record selection and completing verification steps. If the record is not a match, the request will not deliver the intended privacy outcome.</p>

    <h2>Step-by-step Intelius opt-out</h2>
    <h3>1. Find the correct listing</h3>
    <p>Locate the profile that matches the correct name and location. Verify details such as age range or relatives to avoid removing the wrong record.</p>

    <h3>2. Submit the opt-out request</h3>
    <p>Use Intelius’s official opt-out instructions. Provide the listing URL and a contact email, and follow the prompts carefully.</p>

    <h3>3. Complete verification</h3>
    <p>Email verification is commonly required. Respond promptly and keep a record of confirmation. This documentation helps if a follow-up is needed.</p>

    <h3>4. Confirm removal and document results</h3>
    <p>Re-check the listing after several days. If it remains visible, use the site’s support channels and reference the original request.</p>

    <h2>Why listings return</h2>
    <p>Most re-listings are caused by data refreshes from upstream sources. When public records or commercial data feeds update, a new listing can appear even after a successful removal. Monitoring allows for quick identification and re-submission.</p>
    <p>Multiple name variations or shared addresses can also produce more than one profile. A complete review helps ensure every relevant listing is handled.</p>

    <h2>How Hardline Privacy improves outcomes</h2>
    <p>Hardline Privacy runs a diagnostic scan to identify exposure across multiple brokers, then submits and tracks opt-out requests through official processes. Each result is verified and monitored for reappearance. This structured approach protects households without relying on shortcuts.</p>
    <p>Families often need coverage for multiple people. The service provides clear documentation and follow-up so that removals are not missed.</p>

    <h2>Privacy maintenance over time</h2>
    <p>Removal is not a one-time event. Data brokers update on different schedules, and profiles can reappear when sources refresh. A monitoring plan reduces the chance of surprises and keeps exposure low. For more information, visit the <a href="/">homepage</a> and review plan options on the <a href="/pricing">pricing page</a>.</p>

    <h2>FAQ</h2>
    <h3>Is Intelius removal guaranteed?</h3>
    <p>No. Outcomes depend on the site’s processes and verification requirements. A compliant request improves the likelihood of success but cannot guarantee removal.</p>
    <h3>What if the listing is inaccurate?</h3>
    <p>Even inaccurate listings can create exposure. The opt-out process is still the recommended path to remove a listing.</p>
    <h3>How often should monitoring happen?</h3>
    <p>Quarterly scans and alerts are common, but households with elevated exposure may prefer more frequent checks.</p>
